# VARIABLES

In JavaScript, a variable is a container that holds a value. The value can be a number, string, boolean, object, or any other data type. Variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout your code.

To create a variable in JavaScript, you use the var, let, or const keyword followed by the name you want to give to the variable. For example:
`
var myVariable = "Hello world!";
let myNumber = 42;
const PI = 3.14;
`
