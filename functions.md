# FUNCTIONS

Functions in JavaScript are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They allow you to write code once and use it multiple times without duplicating the code. You can think of functions as mini-programs within your main program.

Here's an example of a simple function in JavaScript:

`
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
`
